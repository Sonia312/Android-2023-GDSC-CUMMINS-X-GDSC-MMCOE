## Contributing to this Repo

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/Google-Developer-Student-Club-CCOEW/Android-2023/fork) repository.

**2.** Clone the forked repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/project_name.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd Android-2023
```

**4.** Creating a new branch (IMP) 🌱
This is one of the very important step that you should follow to contribute in Open Source. A branch helps to manage the workflow, isolate your code and does not creates a mess. To create a new branch:

```bash
$ git branch <name_of_branch>
$ git checkout -b <name_of_branch>
```

Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**5.** Make changes in source code. 🚀

**6.** Stage your changes and commit 📝

```bash
# Add changes to Index
git add .

# Commit to the local repo
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** At this point you can use the git push command to push the changes to the current branch of your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**8.** Create a [Pull Request/PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) 🛠️ 

**9.** **Congratulations!**  🎉 Sit and relax, you've made your contribution to Android Development repository of GDSC Cummins under hacktoberfest 2023.  🌟
